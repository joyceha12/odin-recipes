HTML Practice Run ^o^  
Task: Create an interactive recipe site that links to different dishes and desserts.  
In this project, I reviewed the basic Git workflow using commands like 
"git add" to stage, "git commit -m" to "save", and "git push" to publish
my work on GitHub". I also practiced writing HTML boilerplate for the main
webpage and added relatives link to individual recipes. In each recipe, I included a visual and listed ingredients in an unordered list and instructions in an order list.
